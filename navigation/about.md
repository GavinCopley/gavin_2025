        <p>Hey, I'm Gavin Copley. I am a junior at <span style="color: blue;">Del </span><span style="color: green;">Norte</span>
        High School. I am 16. I like to play video games and spend time with friends. I enjoy computer science and CSP is probably my favorite class this year. My classes are: CSP, APUSH, Calc AB, Marketing Econ, and Amlit. I am excited to start this new school year and am optimistic towards what this year holds.
