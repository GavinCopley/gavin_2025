### [Bugatti Chiron Tourbillon](https://jacobandco.com/timepieces/bugatti-chiron-tourbillon?srsltid=AfmBOorBqojtoTTA23P9GMciRWHVKE71SGrrfb-_GF_UZ6HPj6nFz6NV)
About a $400,000 watch that looks like a Bugatti Chiron engine. The pistons in the engine also move like a real car. Very interesting watch with some cool engineering behind it.

### [Casino Tourbillon](https://jacobandco.com/timepieces/casino-tourbillon?srsltid=AfmBOoqx2eo2e2bWU7OGga635MpEV_hr0flMuMcZ4tcWYADrdAgJeP7g)
About a $300,000 watch that looks like a roulette. It include a button that spins the inside and has a ball in the middle that allows for the table to be played. A functional and nice looking watch.

### [Caviar Tourbillon](https://jacobandco.com/timepieces/caviar-tourbillon/white-diamonds-tsavorites)
From $600,000 to $1.6m watch that can look very nice. It can be emerald, diamond, ruby, gold, and in any form it looks luxurious and fantastic. No gimmicks, it just looks great.
