## Introduction of Key Interests and how Coding intersects with those interests
Finance & Economics
- interested in macroeconomic trends
- finance
- logic behind markets.

Technology & Coding
- enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems.
- use coding to visualize data, simulate economic behaviors, and automate tasks.

Where They Intersect
- create tools and scripts to analyze financial data.
- explore ways to represent money flow through interactive visualizations or dashboards.
- inspired by my brother's work building a website/platform for my Dad's financial companyâ€”showing how tech directly supports business goals.

## Highlight your Favorite project(s) 

My favorite project that I have worked on is of course MediPulse. MediPulse has definitely been the most proud I have been from making a project. Being the Scrum Master of my team, it has been a lot of hardwork, but was definitely worth it in the end. Making a project for PilotCity and a potential internship really put things on the line and motviated me and my team to follow through and make a product worth talking about. We have all put so much time into it and I am really happy with how it has turned out. THere is still so much stuff I coudl do to make it even better and I am glad to have embarked on this journey.
