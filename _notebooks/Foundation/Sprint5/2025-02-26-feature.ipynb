    "One of my features that I chose to highlight is my vinStore api feature. This feature is not just an API, but also has clean frontend UI that allows the user to seamlessly interact with the storing of data. The user can choose to upload their VIN to our database, which we then send the the Department of Transportation's VIN decoder to get information about their car. We get: make, model, year, and engine type. This is information we store and display to the user so they will not only know this information about their car, but we can also use this data and integrate it with other features, like posts and mechanic tips."
