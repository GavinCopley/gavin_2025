    "I did really good on the MCQ overall and I'm really proud of myself. I did most of the MCQ with Aarush so we could help each other understand questions that we didn't understand. Only a couple of the questions I would have gotten wrong if it weren't for him explaining something to him. One of those moments was for binary where I miscounted a number and he told me I was wrong."
