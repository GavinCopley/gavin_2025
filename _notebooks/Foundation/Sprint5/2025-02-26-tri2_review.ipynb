    "## Future of CompSci\n",
    "I have really enjoyed these past two years of doing computer science. Starting with CSSE and having my brothers take CompSci with you as well has made me enjoy this class a lot. I hope to continue this computer science journey further into the future. I have learned a lot of skills that I would be able to take to the real world, like Agile Methodology, Scrum, Kanban boards, etc. I have overall really enjoyed this course and I am exicted to continue this in our third trimester."
