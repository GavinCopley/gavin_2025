    "## Reflection\n",
    "After that presentation, I feel like I understand a lot more about the field of cybersecurity. The presenters were really good and I was able to learn a lot about what they were saying (even if the microphone was a little quiet). I didn't expect Mr. Tomasz to be able to talk that much about his work, since the FBI is usually pretty private about it. I don't think I will go into cyber security as a career, but it was really interesting to hear from all 3 of the speakers about their work in the cybersecurity field. From Tricia I gathered that if you want to succeed in the field you need people skills, which I have heard about a lot of different fields. It's interesting to hear about all of the jobs that people have under the umbrella of cybersecurity because if you don't know anything about it it feels like it is only one line of jobs, but it is actually manyu differnt jobs that makes up cybersecurity.\n",
