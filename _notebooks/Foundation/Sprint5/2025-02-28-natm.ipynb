Some key things people had comments on is our presentation skills; people wanted our presentation to be a little smoother and to have everyone present instead of just a few people. There was no comments on specific features except the recommended cars feature which someone said needed improvement and more color. Other people said that the project as a whole was very complete and nice looking, but it was a little confusing with the navigation. Overall, N@TM was a success and we learned a lot from it."
