    "However, I ran into a problem with making. Even after I verified my nbconvert existed and was the right version with \"jupyter --version\", it still would say that it was missing in the terminal when I tried to make. I redid the whole setup guide at least 2 more times, but I kept running into the same issue. I asked Mr. Mortensen and he was able to diagnose what the issue was, but couldn't find a fix. A student in the class as the time was able to fix it. However, it was only a temperary fix that broke again. I managed to fix it by going to an [older version](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//5.a/c4.1/2023/08/16/github_pages_setup_IPYNB_2_.html#make-commands-local-build-make-make-clean-make-stop-make-convert) of the setup guide and running these commands:\n",
    "- pip install nbconvert  # library for notebook conversion\n",
    "- pip install nbformat  # notebook file utility\n",
    "- pip install pyyaml  # notebook frontmatter <br><br>\n",
