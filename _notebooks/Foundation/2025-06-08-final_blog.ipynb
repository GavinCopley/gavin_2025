    "My favorite project that I have worked on is of course MediPulse. MediPulse has definitely been the most proud I have been from making a project. Being the Scrum Master of my team, it has been a lot of hardwork, but was definitely worth it in the end. Making a project for PilotCity and a potential internship really put things on the line and motviated me and my team to follow through and make a product worth talking about. We have all put so much time into it and I am really happy with how it has turned out. THere is still so much stuff I coudl do to make it even better and I am glad to have embarked on this journey."
