    "## Reflection\n",
    "I learned quite a bit during Sprint 3. It required more planning and thinking between our group in order to make a good room for Flocker. I was the Integrator of Integrators for my period and I was the scrum master of my group. I created a repository for my period and accepted all pull requests that had no merge conflicts. I worked with the Scrum Master of Scrum Masters, Mihir Bapat, on our theme and helped everyone with the backend. I had a pretty good grasp on our assignments and stuff so I ended up helping a lot of people. I helped people with their errors on venv and other problems with the backend and flask. For my group, I was a frontend dev but I also ended up working with the backend."

    "I understand the backend and how it communicates with the frontend a lot better. I somewhat understand APIs and how databases work. I worked a lot on the frontend to make it look nice and did a little to the backend. I added the posts from the post.md in navigation to our site and made it so that it was Shared Interest instead of the home version. I worked with Bailey and Sonika on that and we worked together to find how to do it."
