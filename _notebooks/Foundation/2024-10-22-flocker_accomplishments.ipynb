    "We have built a very nice room in Flocker. It can be seen [here](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/flocker_frontend/shared_interests/football/). We have a chat that isn't live yet but the frontend basics are there and it has a strong foundation. We have the ability for people to add posts that store to their local computer. The posts have reactions which also save. It is a very strong foundation upon which the backend could make this flocker room into something great. My team and I have made great strides in making something worth being proud of."
