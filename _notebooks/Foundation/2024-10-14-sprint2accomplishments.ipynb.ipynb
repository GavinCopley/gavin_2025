    "## Reflection\n",
    "The project was so much fun, and it became a very enriching learning process for each one of us involved in its making. I managed to internalize very basic notions about programming that were quite useful in software development. I was able to get some knowledge of working with <strong>variables</strong> to store and manipulate data efficiently. I was also introduced to <strong>data abstraction</strong>, which helped me deal with complexity, considering the breakdown of the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I also worked with <strong>mathematical expressions</strong> to make various calculations and solve some problems that included numerical operations. Finally, <strong>strings</strong> handling became really handy in working with textual data by allowing manipulation and analysis of the latter in a variety of ways. Understanding <strong>booleans</strong> was another important part in the learning curve since it gave me the capability of making true/false decisions within my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also did <strong>conditionals and nested conditionals</strong>, (which me and my group taught) which played a very important role in making programs more dynamic. I embedded iteration-ways of repeating certain actions effectively-with the use of <strong>loops</strong>; this is quite an important feature when there are lots of repetitive tasks. Lastly, I was introduced to <strong>lists</strong>, which are powerful data types that helped me in managing and organizing collections of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this project greatly increased my knowledge about programming and has given me a solid foundation upon which I can succeed in future programming endeavers."
